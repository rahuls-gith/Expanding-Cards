# Expanding-Cards
This is a Project to showcase CSS Transitions and vanilla JavaScript Implementation within HTML and CSS without use of any Front-End Frameworks

Key Points while working on such projects:
1. All custom fonts are to be imported in CSS because they are not part of the content, rather part of the styling (including background images and font-awesome for custom images)

2. * styling applies to all tags - Starting from the <html> right down to the element

3. overflow: - Provides scroll if element content extend greater than the width of the element / screen. 
	* hidden: No scroll bar anywhere (the content shows up as much as possible and the rest of the content is cut off)
	* auto: Gives scroll bar inside the parent element to be able to see all the immediate children (the content shows up as much as possible and the rest of the content will be visible if you scroll).
	* default: Gives scroll bar for the whole window to be able to scroll the screen
